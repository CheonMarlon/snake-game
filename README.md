# Snake Game in Python

A classic Snake game implemented using Python's `turtle` graphics library. The game features smooth controls, dynamic score tracking, and varying food shapes and colors. It is a simple, interactive game where the player controls a snake to eat food, growing longer with each bite, and avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Features
- **Snake Movement**: Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of your current score and high score.
- **Randomized Food**: Each time the snake eats food, the food's position, shape, and color are randomized.
- **Boundary and Self-Collision**: The game resets if the snake collides with the boundary or its own body.
- **Increasing Speed**: The snake's speed increases slightly with each food consumed.
